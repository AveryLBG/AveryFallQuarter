Identity

    [My company] is an way for upcoming indie devs to get their work out and for game enjoyers to find the game that speaks to them.

Problem

    Some game devs don't get enough publicity, and players miss out on amazing games.

Our solutions 

    Our website allows players to try out games and buy or rent "packages", which are groups of many games with a similar trait that they may like or want to try.

Target Market

    The target audience is anyone who is interested in games, whether they're an adult, teen, or child, and upcoming game developers and development studios.

The Competion

    There are other online game stores, namely Steam and Itch.io

Revenue Streams 

    We would make money from taking money from sales

Marketing Activities

    We would have a marketing team post highlight videos and streams of our featured games, along with normal ads.

Expenses

    The main expenses would be marketing, making the site, and keeping up the servers.

Team and key roles

    The roles we would need are site developers, a marketing team, a team of execs, and data collection.

Milestones

    As the business grows, we will get better marketing. We can measure progress by how many devs post to our platform. A huge milestone is being popular enough to where someone would tell their friend who is new to pc's to use the platform
