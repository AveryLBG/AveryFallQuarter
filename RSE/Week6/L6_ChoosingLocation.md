3. What would be the business type for your idea? What are examples of other businesses of that same type?
My buisness would be a remote retail service that sells copies of games and pc supplies.

4. Create a list of everyhting your business would need to launch and maintain, then find an example of a location that checks all those boxes. Where is that location? We would need a place to store a game, and the location should be close to a residential area so we can get games to people fast.

5. Who are the main stakeholders of your business? what location ameneties do you think they need most based on your business idea?
The main stakeholders are the other people working on the game and the customers. The main stakeholders are the game suppliers, customers, and other employes. The location amenities they would need are easy parking and accesibility to streets & highways.

6. Take the location you chose from question 4. How saturated is that area? What businesses similar to yours are within 5 miles of your location? What are examples of other busineses in the area that are complimentary to yours? The store would be online, but the main competitors would be newegg (online) and gamestop (irl). Newegg only has 6 locations so we would just need to find out what town we can set up at where we would be closer (and therefore have faster shipping), and since we're online and gamestop is irl we could just set in areas far from gamestops.

7. What are zoning laws? Take the location you chose in question 4. Research and find one zoning law that applies to the type of your business idea.
(Ex. Search "Zoning law for mobile retail in Richmond, CA")
We would need both a home occupation and business permit, and can't have more than one employee live there.git
